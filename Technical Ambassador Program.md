# TECHNICAL AMBASSADOR PROGRAM

---
## How does the program work?
1. This program is designed for technical students and young developers who want to learn ink! & WASM and contribute to the growth of Astar & Shiden Network.
2. Everyone is welcomed to apply but seats are limited. So please do your best during the interview to get shortlisted.
3. Shortlisted candicates will be given a 2-month trial period before the rewards kick in.
4. After the 2-month period, we will do an assessment on all your contributions. If you do well, you will start receiving the monthly rewards.
5. This program is not really about getting rewarded. It is more about learning, participating and contributing to the growth of Astar Network. 
6. This program is not a form of an employment. It is more like an initiative to encourage the community to learn ink! and WASM.
