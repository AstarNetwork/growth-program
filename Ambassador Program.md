# AMBASSADOR PROGRAM

---
## How does the program work?
1. This program is designed for community members that want to contribute to the growth of Astar Network.
2. All Ambassadors are encouraged to paricipate in peforming the tasks. Lack of participation may result in the revocation of your Ambassador role.
3. There will be basic tasks and supplementary tasks every month.
4. Basic tasks are mandatory and will be recurring.
5. Supplementary tasks are optional, which you can choose depending on your skills and talent. You can choose **up to 2** different supplementary tasks in a month.
6. Each task is given specific points and you need to achieve at least 40% of the total points to qualify to receive the rewards.
7. If you achieve 100%, you will get the full rewards. If you achieve only 50%, you will get half of the full rewards.
8. If there are surplus ASTR in a particular month, it will be distributed equally to those who achieved ≥90%.
9. In case that there are surplus ASTR and no one achieves ≥90%, the surplus SDN will be sent to the Community Treasury or carried forward to the next month.
10. On top of the fixed reward pool, there will be an additional 50,000 ASTR to be distributed to the Top 5 contributors every month. 
11. In case that you do a group work with other ambassadors e.g. We have 2 ambassadors from Thailand and they jointly organized a local meetup, please submit your contribution individually (stating that it is a group work). This is to avoid confusion. Points will be given individually.
12. An example of how the calculation works can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m4a1B77nuPh7dxcKk2kVyPVt1l185m4C/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115923092849552143416&rtpof=true&sd=true).
13. The reward pool comes from dApp staking: [ASTR Rewards](https://astar.subscan.io/account/ZfEuzYHyfo5TZfAx9fsntdkx2W4gDFLPwUNeqSrJTpQJXDc). The reward pool may change depending on how much it is getting.
