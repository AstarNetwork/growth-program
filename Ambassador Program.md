# AMBASSADOR PROGRAM

---
## How does the program work?
1. There will be basic tasks and supplementary tasks every month.
2. Basic tasks are mandatory and will be recurring.
3. Supplementary tasks are optional, which you can choose depending on your skills and talent. You can choose to do **up to 2** different supplementary tasks in a month.
4. Each task is given specific points and you need to achieve at least 40% of the total points to qualify to receive the rewards.
5. If you achieve 100%, you will get the full rewards. If you achieve only 50%, you will get half of the full rewards.
6. If there are surplus SDN in a particular month, it will be distributed equally to those who achieved ≥90%.
7. In case that there is a surplus SDN and no one achieves ≥90%, the surplus SDN will be sent to the Treasury or carried forward to the next month.
8. In case that you do a group work with other ambassadors e.g. We have 2 ambassadors from Thailand and they jointly organized a local meetup, please submit your contribution individually (stating that it is a group work). This is to avoid confusion. Points will be given individually.
9. An example of how the calculation works can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m4a1B77nuPh7dxcKk2kVyPVt1l185m4C/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115923092849552143416&rtpof=true&sd=true).
10. The reward pool comes from dApp staking: [SDN Reward](https://shiden.subscan.io/account/ZfEuzYHyfo5TZfAx9fsntdkx2W4gDFLPwUNeqSrJTpQJXDc?tab=reward) and [ASTR Rewards](https://astar.subscan.io/account/ZfEuzYHyfo5TZfAx9fsntdkx2W4gDFLPwUNeqSrJTpQJXDc). The reward pool may change depending on how much it is getting.
