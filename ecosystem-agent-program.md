# AGENT PROGRAM

---
## How does the program work?
1. All Agents are encouraged to participate in performing the tasks. Not participating will result in no rewards.
2. There will be core tasks and optional tasks every month.
3. Core tasks are mandatory and will be recurring.
4. Optional tasks can be chosen depending on your skills and talent. You can choose **up to 2** different optional tasks in a month.
5. If you achieve 100%, you will get the full rewards. If you achieve only 50%, you will get half of the full rewards.
6. If there are surplus ASTR in a particular month, it will be distributed equally to those who achieved ≥80%.
7. In case that there are surplus ASTR and no one achieves ≥80%, the surplus ASTR will remain in the Community Treasury.
8. In addition to the reward pool, an additional 30% ASTR bonus will be distributed to those who achieve an average ≥90% for each quarter.
9. In case that you do a group work with other agents e.g. We have 2 agents from Thailand and they jointly organized a local meetup, please submit your contribution individually (stating that it is a group work). This is to avoid confusion. Points will be given individually.
10. An example of how the calculation works can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m4a1B77nuPh7dxcKk2kVyPVt1l185m4C/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115923092849552143416&rtpof=true&sd=true).
11. The reward pool comes from dApp staking: [ASTR Rewards](https://astar.subscan.io/account/ZfEuzYHyfo5TZfAx9fsntdkx2W4gDFLPwUNeqSrJTpQJXDc). The reward pool is not fixed. It may change depending on circumstances e.g. if we have more Agents, we will increase the pool.
12. The score is evaluated and determined by the Community Growth Lead, with input from the Astar Core team.
