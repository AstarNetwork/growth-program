# UI TESTER DAO

### What
This is a program that the **Agents** can participate by testing the Astar Portal UI.

### Why
Currently, only the core team members are testing the bi-weekly UI update. We want more testers. 10 eyes are better than 2 eyes.

### How
1. Four (4) testers will be selected every month, on rotation basis.
2. The testers will participate in the testing activities which are done on a bi-weekly basis.
3. The testers will be notified in the Agent Telegram channel when the testing is ready.
4. Report bugs (if any) and steps to reproduce the bugs.
5. Testing day: Saturday - Monday
6. Fixing day: Monday - Tuesday
7. Release day: Wednesday
8. Rewards: Up to $100/month for each tester.

*Rewards are paid in $ASTR tokens.*
