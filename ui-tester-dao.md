## What
This is a program that the **All-Star Ambassadors** can participate by testing the Astar Portal UI. This will commence on Aug 2023.

Currently, only the core team members are testing the bi-weekly UI update. We want more testers. 10 eyes are better than 2 eyes.

## How
1. Four (4) testers will be selected every month, on rotation basis.
2. The testers will participate in the testing activities which are done on a bi-weekly basis.
3. The testers will be notified in the Ambassador Telegram channel when the testing is ready.
4. Report bugs (if any) and steps to reproduce the bugs.
5. Testing day: Saturday - Monday
6. Fixing day: Monday - Tuesday
7. Release day: Wednesday
8. Rewards: Up to $100/month for each tester.

*Rewards are paid in $ASTR tokens.
