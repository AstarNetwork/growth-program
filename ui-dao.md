# UI DAO

---
## What
This is a program that the existing Ambassadors can participate by making UI fixes. 

## Why
Astar wants to become a DAO at one point, therefore having the Ambassadors to participate in the technical tasks is important. The UI is a good place to start with and we will eventually open this program to the public and add more critical tasks.

## How
1. All the tasks will be published [here](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/astar-apps/issues).
2. Each task comes with its own Tier according to the table below.
3. Ambassadors can pick the task that they want to do on a first come first serve basis. 
4. If you have picked your task, you must complete it within the expected time. 
5. Failure to complete your task will put you into suspension for 2 months. 
6. The Core Developers will review the completed tasks and the rewards will be distributed within 2 weeks.  

| Tier | Difficulty | Expected Time Of Completion | Rewards | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Very simple tasks | 1/2-1 day | $100 |  
| 2 | Mid complexity tasks | 2-3 days | $400 |
| 3 | Complex tasks | Up to 5 days | $800 |
Rewards are paid in $ASTR tokens.
