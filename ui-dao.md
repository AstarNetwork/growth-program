# UI DAO

---
## What
This is a program that the existing Ambassadors can participate by making UI fixes. 

## Why
Astar wants to become a DAO at one point, therefore having the Ambassadors to participate in the technical tasks is important. The UI is a good place to start with and we will eventually open this program to the public and add more critical tasks.

## How
1. All the tasks will be published [HERE](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/astar-apps/issues).
2. Each task comes with its own Tier according to the table below.
3. Ambassadors can pick the task that they want to do on a first come first serve basis. 
4. If you have picked your task, you must complete it within the expected time. 
5. Failure to complete your task will put you into suspension for 2 months. 
6. The Core Developers will review the completed tasks and the rewards will be distributed within 2 weeks.  

Rewards are paid in $ASTR tokens.
 
 ## Guide For Participants
 1. Look for the tasks [HERE](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/astar-apps/issues).
 2. The available tasks will come with the UI DAO tag.
 3. If you choose to take the task, please leave a comment and your ASTR wallet address.
 4. Complete the task by creating a PR within the expected time.
 5. The codes will be reviewed and a rating of 1-5 will be given. 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest.
 6. You shall receive the rewards based on the difficulty tier and rating.

| Tier | Difficulty | Expected Time Of Completion | Rewards | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Very simple tasks | 1-2 day | up to $100 |  
| 2 | Mid complexity tasks | 4-6 days | up to $300 |
| 3 | Complex tasks | 5 -10 days | up to $500 |

Rewards are paid in $ASTR tokens.

 ### Examples
 1. Alice chose to take a Tier 1 task and completed it within the expected time frame. The codes were reviewed, it was very clean and it was rated five (5). Alice received an incentive of $100 worth of ASTR.
 2. Bob chose to take a Tier 3 task and completed it within the expected time frame. The codes were reviewed, but it is not the best so it was rated three (3). Bob received an incentive of $300 worth of ASTR.
