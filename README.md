# Community rewards
## Overview
Astar is a community-driven project, and we need you to help grow our ecosystem. We have created an open Ambassador contribution system where every community member can join and support the Astar ecosystem. You can collect points and receive rewards through dApp staking if your contributions are valid. Joining the Ambassador contribution system as a community member is also the perfect way to show us that you are the Ambassador we need for the Astar ecosystem. It's also the ideal way to educate yourself about Astar and the Polkadot ecosystem.


# Ambassador Program
## Overview
Astar Network is a Multi-Chain decentralized application layer on Polkadot that natively supports Cross Virtual Machine (X-VM) communication (Ethereum Virtual Machine, WebAssembly) and Layer2 scaling solutions (Optimistic virtual machine, ZK rollups). Our goal is to become a blockchain that is owned by the community. We cannot achieve this without your help. As such, we are on the lookout for active members of the community to help support the ecosystem, to help promote and raise awareness of Astar Network. These ambassadors will officially represent us in their respective regions and will play a key role in helping to shape the future of Astar ecosystem.

## Criteria
* Good understanding of Astar vision, features and latest developments.
* Experience with community engagement on social media (Telegram, Discord, meetups).
* Interested in growing & educating the community for Astar ecosystem & Web3.0.
* Committed to helping Astar Network become a community owned blockchain.

## Expectations
* Foster and grow a strong community in your respective region.
* Be transparent about your contributions and tasks (add tasks to Hubspot).
* Translation of articles into your native language.
* Organisation of meetups for the local community (once Covid settles down).
* Attend events and conferences on behalf of the team.
* Attend monthly Ambassador call + one-on-one meeting every quarter.

## Benefits

# Roles
Candidate -> Ambassador -> Senior Ambassador -> Regional Head

Everyone starts off as a candidate. When your application is approved you will become an apprentice ambassador for one quarter. As time progresses, the team will evaluate your progress, commitment and performance to determine if you are ready to take on more responsibility as a fully fledged ambassador. Eventually you will be promoted to a senior ambassador and finally regional head where you will oversee and be responsible for all activities that happen in your region. Your role will also be reflected accordingly in our official Telegram and Discord channels.
