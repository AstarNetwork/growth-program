# Ambassador Program
## Overview
Astar Network is a Multi-Chain decentralized application layer on Polkadot that natively supports Cross Virtual Machine (X-VM) communication (Ethereum Virtual Machine, WebAssembly) and Layer2 scaling solutions (Optimistic virtual machine, ZK rollups). Our goal is to become a blockchain that is owned by the community. We cannot achieve this without your help. As such, we are on the lookout for active members of the community to help support the ecosystem, to help promote and raise awareness of Astar Network. These ambassadors will officially represent us in their respective regions and will play a key role in helping to shape the future of Astar ecosystem.

* Experience with community engagement on social media (Telegram, Discord, meetups).
* Engaged in our community.
* Interested in growing & educating the community for Astar ecosystem & Web3.0.
* Committed to helping Astar Network become a community owned blockchain.

## Expectations
* Foster and grow a strong community in your respective region.
* Be transparent about your contributions and tasks (add tasks to Hubspot).
* Translation of articles into your native language.
* Organisation of meetups for the local community (once Covid settles down).
* Attend events and conferences on behalf of the team.
* Attend monthly Ambassador call + one-on-one meeting every quarter.

## Benefits
* Earn passive income through dapp staking!
* Be a part of the builders program committee and help to grow our ecosystem!
* Build a reputation (and maybe even your future career!) for yourself!
* Work along side notable people / projects in this space!

# Roles
Candidate -> Ambassador -> Senior Ambassador -> Regional Head

Everyone starts off as a candidate. When your application is approved you will become an apprentice ambassador for one quarter. As time progresses, the team will evaluate your progress, commitment and performance to determine if you are ready to take on more responsibility as a fully fledged ambassador. Eventually you will be promoted to a senior ambassador and finally regional head where you will oversee and be responsible for all activities that happen in your region. Your role will also be reflected accordingly in our official Telegram and Discord channels.

# Ambassador Reward Program - Updated January 2022
## How does the program work?
1. There will be basic task and supplementary tasks every month.
2. Basic task is mandatory and will be recurring.
3. Supplementary is optional, which you can choose depending your skills and talent. You can choose to do **up to 3** different supplementary tasks in a month.
4. Each task is given specific points and you need to achieve at least 40% of the total points to qualify to receive the rewards.
5. If you achieve 100%, you will get the full rewards. If you achieve only 50%, you will get half of the full rewards.
6. If there are surplus SDN in a particular month, it will be distributed equally to those who achieved ≥90%.
7. In case that there is a surplus SDN and no one achieves ≥90%, the surplus SDN will be sent to the Treasury or carried forward to the next month.
8. It is **MANDATORY** for each ambassador to participate. Failure to achieve at least 50% points for a period of 3 consecutive months will result in the termination of your ambassadorship.
9. In case that you want to work in a group with other ambassadors e.g. We have 2 ambassadors from Thailand, please submit your work as a group work and the rewards will be split equally.
10. An example of how the calculation works can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m4a1B77nuPh7dxcKk2kVyPVt1l185m4C/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115923092849552143416&rtpof=true&sd=true).
11. The reward pool comes from the [Dapp Staking Reward](https://shiden.subscan.io/account/ZfEuzYHyfo5TZfAx9fsntdkx2W4gDFLPwUNeqSrJTpQJXDc?tab=reward). The contract is getting around 300 - 400 SDN/day so we will distribute 10,000 - 12,000 SDN per month (may change depending on how much reward is earned).
12. When Astar dApp staking is live, we will inlcude ASTR rewards.
