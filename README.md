# Community rewards
## Overview
Astar is a community-driven project, and we need you to help grow our ecosystem. We have created an open growth program where every community member can join and support the Astar ecosystem. You can collect points and receive rewards through dApp staking if your contributions are valid. Joining the growth program as a community member is also the perfect way to show us that you are the Ambassador we need for the Astar ecosystem. It's also the ideal way to educate yourself about Astar and the Polkadot ecosystem.

## How to contribute
* Create an account on [Github](https://www.github.com).
* Visit our forum for the complete [Guidelines](https://forum.astar.network/t/start-of-our-community-program/1367).

As such, we are on the lookout for active members of the community to help support the ecosystem, to help promote and raise awareness of Astar Network. These ambassadors will officially represent us in their respective regions and will play a key role in helping to shape the future of Astar ecosystem.

# Roles
Candidate -> Ambassador -> Senior Ambassador -> Regional Head

Everyone starts off as a candidate. When your application is approved you will become an apprentice ambassador for one quarter. As time progresses, the team will evaluate your progress, commitment and performance to determine if you are ready to take on more responsibility as a fully fledged ambassador. Eventually you will be promoted to a senior ambassador and finally regional head where you will oversee and be responsible for all activities that happen in your region. Your role will also be reflected accordingly in our official Telegram and Discord channels.

# Ambassador Reward Program - Updated January 2022
## How does the program work?
1. There will be basic task and supplementary tasks every month.
2. Basic task is mandatory and will be recurring.
3. Supplementary is optional, which you can choose depending your skills and talent. You can choose to do up to 2 different supplementary tasks in a month.
4. Each task is given a specific points and you need to achieve at least 50% of the total points to qualify to receive the rewards.
5. If you achieve 100%, you will get the full rewards. If you achieve only 50%, you will get half of the full rewards.
6. If there are surplus SDN in a particular month, it will be distributed equally to those who achieved ≥90%.
7. In the case that there is a surplus SDN and no one achieves ≥90%, the surplus SDN will be sent to the Treasury or carried forward to the next month.
8. It is **MANDATORY** for each ambassador to participate. Failure to achieve at least 50% points for a period of 3 consecutive months will result in the termination of your ambassadorship.
9. An example of how the calculation works can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m4a1B77nuPh7dxcKk2kVyPVt1l185m4C/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115923092849552143416&rtpof=true&sd=true).
10. The reward pool comes from the [Dapp Staking Reward](https://shiden.subscan.io/account/ZfEuzYHyfo5TZfAx9fsntdkx2W4gDFLPwUNeqSrJTpQJXDc?tab=reward). The contract is getting around 400 SDN/day so we will distribute 12,000 SDN per month.
